                        As the current co-president of the freshman caucus, Andy
                        Xian has a curious mindset and is someone who loves to
                        try new things especially now that he's attending
                        Stuyvesant High School.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Andy ran for freshman caucus as he has a huge passion
                        for leadership and bringing out change in his community,
                        as supported by his 5 total years of student union
                        experience from elementary and middle school. As of the
                        2021-2022 school year, he is most looking forward to
                        accomplishing the sports catalog, talent month, freshman
                        olympics, newsletters, homework policy reinforcements,
                        band microphone policy, and chat n' chill meets.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Alongside freshman caucus, Andy is also an epeeist on
                        the fencing team, a trombonist in symphonic band, and a
                        member of a few other clubs. He used to be a part of
                        student union communications, badminton, debate, and
                        tutoring. In the future, he would love to volunteer for
                        community service.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In his free time, he loves to explore the realm of his
                        hobbies, which include doing sports and exercising,
                        playing and listening to music, watching and playing
                        games, literature, cooking, and traveling (which he
                        hasn't been able to do in a long while).

                        Fin, current Freshman Co-President, hopes to provide the
                        Freshman body with fun memories despite the Covid
                        situation this year. They are eager to show everyone all
                        the fun events that we have planned for this year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Fin ran for Freshman Caucus this year with their friend
                        Andy because they both had a shared passion in serving
                        the community and helping others. They believe that with
                        their position as Freshman Caucus President they can
                        make influential decisions for the school.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Along with Student Union, Fin is also a part of numerous
                        activities in the school such as sports team manager,
                        Red Cross, Indicator Business, Spectator Layout, Leader
                        in the Stuyvesant Asian Coalition, and others. Outside
                        of school, Fin enjoys learning and making, and they
                        especially love playing the piano and ukulele.

        <h2 class="subtitle">What's our experience?</h2>
        <p>
            Both Andy and Fin have experience with leadership as Fin was the
            Editor-In-Chief of the Yearbook Committee, member of the ARISTA
            Honors Society, and currently a member of the Stuyvesant Asian
            Coalition as well as a manager on the Girls Varsity Volleyball Team.
            These past and current leadership positions have taught her how to
            effectively collaborate with a team and advocate for changes that
            will benefit the community. As for Andy, he has 4 years of
            experience in the SU itself; in 5th grade, he was a member of the
            student union, in 6th grade, he was the 6th grade delegate, in 7th
            grade, he was the vice president, and finally, in 8th grade, he was
            the president of his middle school as well as a member of the SLT
            (Student Leadership Team) and 8th grade Cabinet. Not only that, he
            is currently an announcer in the SU Communications Department.
            During his times in the student union, he worked to create events
            (Spirit Weeks, Fall Dances, Game Nights), fundraisers (Toy Drive,
            Soles for Souls), and addressed school issues to fix (mic + cam
            obligations during remote learning, virtual vs. in-person
            graduation) which all taught him the valuable leadership skills of
            open-mindedness, having a clear vision, and being compassionate
            about what he does.
